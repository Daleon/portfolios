## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Date-Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Daleon/Date-Night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Project completed week two.  This assignment taught me about an abstract data structure called a Binary Search Tree.  I also learned how to use the information stored in said Search Tree. 



Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Repo: https://github.com/Daleon/Date-Night

Notes:

    Testing sufficient, some opportunities to add more isolation tests for supporting methods
    Meets all base expectations
    Solid SRP, opportunity to break health calculations into another class
    Some long methods, overall solid effort at refactoring.

Score:

1. Test-Driven Development
    3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

2. Functional Expectations
    3: Application fulfills all base expectations

3. Breaking Logic into Components
    3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
    3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.



#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Daleon/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)
