#### Black-Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/riverswb/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)



Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Notes:

    Solid testing suite
    Testing: some redundant assertions, watch line length in tests
    Completed through i4
    Some opportunities to extract classes and functionality into modules, overall solid job with division of responsibilities between classes and methods
    Consistent use of best-choice enumerables
    Some opportunities for refactoring (unnecessary local vars, extracting methods into sep classes), but overall strong effort toward organization
    Zero (0) sanitation errors

Scores:

1. Functional Expectations
    3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5
2. Test-Driven Development
    4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
    3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
    3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
5. Enumerable & Collections
    4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
6. Code Sanitation

7. The output from rake sanitation:all shows...
    4: Zero complaints




#### Http-yea-you-know-me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Daleon/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

This project was an exercise for breaking a workflow into a system of coordinating components, practice using TDD at the unit, integration, and acceptance levels, understand how the HTTP request/response cycle works, and practice implementing basic HTTP requests and responses.  It was a very challenging project, and I learned a great deal about organizing and testing my code.

Assessed By: Jeff Casimir

Notes: NONE

Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development
    3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
    2: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).
    
3. Fundamental Ruby & Style
    3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

4. Enumerable & Collections
    3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections

5. Functional Expectations:
    4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

#### Date-Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Daleon/Date-Night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Project completed week two.  This assignment taught me about an abstract data structure called a Binary Search Tree.  I also learned how to use the information stored in said Search Tree. 



Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Notes:

    Testing sufficient, some opportunities to add more isolation tests for supporting methods
    Meets all base expectations
    Solid SRP, opportunity to break health calculations into another class
    Some long methods, overall solid effort at refactoring.

Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development
    3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

2. Functional Expectations
    3: Application fulfills all base expectations

3. Breaking Logic into Components
    3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
    3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.



#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Daleon/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Project completed during week one. The goal was to learn about sorting algorithms and how Ruby works "under the hood" for #sort.

This project was not graded.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


### Complete-Me

This poject was a group project assigned for week three.  I worked with one other developer in my cohort by the name of Nick Gheorghita.  The project timeline was bumpy at first, but after the second of seven days given for the project, we utilized each other's similiar proceeses to achieve a solidly built Trie data structured, text autocomplete program.  I look forward to working with Nick again.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Professional Development Workshops
I've attended numerous sessions at Turing School called "Gear-up".  These sessions are meant to broaden our perception of the sofware development world.
