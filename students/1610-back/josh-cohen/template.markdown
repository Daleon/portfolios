## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Date-Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Daleon/Date-Night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Project completed week two.  This assignment taught me about an abstract data structure called a Binary Search Tree.  I also learned how to use the information stored in said Search Tree. 



Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Notes:

    Testing sufficient, some opportunities to add more isolation tests for supporting methods
    Meets all base expectations
    Solid SRP, opportunity to break health calculations into another class
    Some long methods, overall solid effort at refactoring.

Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development
    3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

2. Functional Expectations
    3: Application fulfills all base expectations

3. Breaking Logic into Components
    3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
    3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.



#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Daleon/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Project completed during week one. The goal was to learn about sorting algorithms.

This project was not graded.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects


### Complete-Me

This poject was a group project assigned for week three.  I worked with one other developer in my cohort by the name of Nick Gheorghita.  The project timeline was bumpy at first, but after the second of seven days given for the project, we utilized each other's similiar proceeses to achieve a solidly built Trie data structured, text autocomplete program.  I look forward to working with Nick again.
